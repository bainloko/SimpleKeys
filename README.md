All code and logic behind them are proprietary, except when explicitly mentioned otherwise.

SimpleKeys was inspired on many other softwares, but that are too difficult to set-up and use, or don't have any support in Portuguese!

To see usage logs from SimpleKeys, head to "%AppData%/simplekeys/logs" on Windows and "~/.config/simplekeys/logs/" on Linux.
